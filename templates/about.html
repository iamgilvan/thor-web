<p>THOR Web contemplates the use of the THOR and THOR 2 methods, helping to compare the results of the methods and contributing to the application in more complex problems, in which a greater number of criteria and alternatives are used. The  system aims to expand and disseminate the use of methods by the scientific community. The THOR Web system was developed at the Military Engineering Institute (IME) located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>
<p>THOR is a multicriteria decision support system for the ranking of discrete alternatives, which eliminates redundant criteria simultaneously considering if the information is dubious and if there is an increase in imprecision in the decision process. In this way, imprecision is quantified, using it in the multicriteria decision support process.</p>
<p>THOR 2 brings an axiomatic evolution of THOR contemplating the natural evolution of knowledge to be incorporated into the algorithm. These modifications provided a better distribution of the weights in the function of non-transitive aggregation and allowed to fully contemplate the model's uncertainty, since all weights are multiplied by their respective fuzzy-approximate index.</p>
